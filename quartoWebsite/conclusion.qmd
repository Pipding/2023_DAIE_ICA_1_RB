title: "Conclusion"
---

Undoubtedly I've learned several things from this assignment, though it's
difficult to parse out the most valuable lessons. I certainly gained some 
appreciation for the utility of a linear regression, which is something I already
intend on utilizing in other contexts. While exploring the data, I also noticed
how easy it is to 'lie' with statistics, either by being selective in sampling
or by presenting things in a misleading way. I noticed this when I was plotting
a linear regression and I noticed that by simply switching the axes it was
possible to produce a plot which seemed to point towards opposite conclusions
(i.e. plotting X against Y vs. plotting Y against X). It was obvious then that 
someone who doesn't understand how linear regression works could easily be misled.
This exploration of the data also demonstrated the importance of collecting data
 - and that over-collecting is likely better than under-collecting - within reason.
 Obviously too large an amount of data becomes impossible to analyze, but too 
 little data can be inconclusive.

In the context of this project the statistics took a bit of a back seat. Not 
having kept track of how my time was spent, I'm fairly confident that a majority 
of my time was spent coming to grips with the idiosyncrasies of Quarto. I still 
feel as though I have a fairly tenuous grasp on Quarto and while I can make it 
do roughly what I want, I don't feel as confident with it as I would with native 
web programming. Quarto seems like a very niche framework created for data
scientists who want to do 'web dev stuff'. I've learned some tricks for debugging
Quarto now, but Quarto as a framework feels a bit immature. The addition of 
web-development features through the Shiny framework doesn't seem to have come
with a set of debugging tools, resulting in a very confusing development
experience.
