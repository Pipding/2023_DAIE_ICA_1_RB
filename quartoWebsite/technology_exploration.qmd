## Quarto Website (Parts A & B)
The Quarto Website makes little use of technologies which
were not covered in class. One exception may be the [dollar_format](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/scales/versions/0.3.0/topics/dollar_format)
function of the [scales](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/scales/) package 
which is used to render numbers as currency (e.g. `200000` -> `â‚¬200,000`).
At one point in the project the [predict](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/car/versions/3.1-2/topics/Predict)
function was used in conjunction with an attempt at logistic regression in an effort
to model the likelihood of a project missing a deadline based on its budget and 
team size, however this proved to be beyond my skill level and so isn't present 
in the final version.

## Quarto Dashboard (Part C)
The Quarto Dashboard uses several packages & methods which were not covered in 
class, mostly in the two **Plot View** sections.

### Project Timelines

#### Vistime
The **Project Timelines** page uses the [vistime](https://shosaco.github.io/vistime/)
package to render timelines. This package is fairly simple to use - the timeline
shown in the dashboard uses almost default settings. The timeline is missing the 
`Urban Adventure` game. This seemed like a bug at first, but it's actually because
the end date for the game is invalid (2023-02-31). I decided not to perform any
data cleaning on this entry because it's ambiguous whether the date should be
2023-02-28 or 2023-03-03.

#### daterangeinput
The [daterangeinput](https://shiny.posit.co/r/reference/shiny/0.12.0/daterangeinput) 
input is configurable and multi-lingual, but unremarkable in that it does what 
one would expect and not much else. In the Quarto Dashboard it is used to set
lower and upper ranges for project start & end dates.
